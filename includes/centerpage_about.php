        <i>myphdidea.org</i> is a not-for-profit initiative supported purely by
        volunteer efforts and donations. The site came about through a concern
        with the overly hierarchical student-professor relationship at graduate
        level, which drives many promising students away from academia following
        completion of their Master. The heart of the problem we believe are
        unimaginative PhD subjects proposed by established researchers, which
        brighter students recoil from dedicating +4 years of hard work to.
        However, it is not fair to criticize if one can't propose a valid
        alternative, and propose valid alternatives our members do: This site
        aims to show that the process of drawing up a PhD project idea is not a
        mystery, but within the reach of anyone imbued with creativity and
        graduate-level mastery of their subject, even in the hard sciences.<br>
        <br>
        The site is meant to be neutral in the sense that we recognize that
        there are several parties to a research project, students, professors
        and (depending on discipline) industry. Different experience levels may
        justify different power distribution models, yet creativity and
        innovation cannot be rote-learned: Since a great idea can come from
        anywhere, an open society should be one where every research pitch is
        evaluated on its own merits, independent of the author's identity. Thus,
        we imagine a fairer system in which (say) 10 % of research funds are
        directly attributed to projects proposed by students, rather than the 0
        % we get currently. As a first step, we have set up this website in
        order to increase transparency of student-professor interactions, and
        give public credit to researchers who are willing to engage with student
        ideas.<br>
