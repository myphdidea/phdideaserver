        	There may be gaps in the understanding of the basic concept, or the assessment is excessively one-sided,
        	overly general, or mainly concerned with peripheral aspects of the proposal e.g. the student's personality. Suggestions
        	for 'improvement' basically amount to scrapping the idea altogether.</div>

        	For example, concrete suggestions are made how to develop or simplify the idea,
        	in order to achieve improved overlap with existing research.
        	If the reviewer believes that compatibility
        	with his own research interests is impossible to achieve, he can point out other researchers,
        	justifying why they would be better suited in scientific terms.</div>
