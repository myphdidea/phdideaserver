	<h2>Registration (researcher)</h2>
	<p>If you are a professor and have ORCID, a
    placeholder profile should have been created for you automatically.
    Login on the left and update it in order to encourage students to contact you
    (conversely, you can contact the author of any idea that has caught your fancy)!
    Also, once logged in, please navigate to "Settings" and deposit your institutional
    e-mail, which will allow you to participate in the popular vote.</p>
    <p>Login is limited to those who have got an ORCID
    profile as in our database (use above searchbar), but existing users can invite new members.
    Currently, 3 existing users who are members of a <a href="index.php?page=institutionlist">recognized university</a> are required. Once your
	3 sponsors have authenticated your details, just use ORCID login and a profile will be created.
